# Help Center API

## Overview

This project is a Help Center API built using the MERN stack. The API allows users to manage "Help Center" cards, which represent different sections of a help center, such as "Branches," "Manage Your Account," "Manage Billing," etc.

React Assignment

1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?

sol. We can use the following React techniques to build common functionality across a component tree:

Moving functions and state to a common parent component and passing them as props to child components is known as "lifting state up." Sharing state between sibling components can be facilitated by this.

Context API: Utilize useContext to create a context that holds shared information or features and that any component in the tree can access. Perfect for transferring state between components that are highly nested.
Custom Hooks: You can reuse shared logic across several components by encapsulating it in a custom hook. This works well for explaining intricate reasoning.

Using props, create a wrapper component that allows other components to have common functionality. This is known as a higher-order component (HOC). useful for giving several components additional behavior.

Render Props: Give a component that offers shared functionality a function to use as a prop. This approach makes it possible to employ shared logic across several components in a flexible way.

2. Why is the useState hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?

sol. Declarative State Management: By enabling you to handle and update state depending on user interactions or other events directly within your component, useState makes declarative state management easier.

Automatic Re-rendering: React automatically re-renders the component in response to any changes in the state, keeping the user interface up to date.

Component encapsulation and management are facilitated via useState, which maintains state local to the component.

versatility with Hooks: It offers excellent versatility when used with other hooks, such as useEffect or useReducer, for more sophisticated state management and side effects.

Simplicity: Even in more complicated cases, it is simple and easy to reason about the API due to its intuitive design.
